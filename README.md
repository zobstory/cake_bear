# cake_bear

### Overview
I have been thinking about overcoming the barrier for allowing more diverse candidates to get into the development field much faster. Though JavaScript / Type Script is more & more popular in back-end development & is the first / easiet language to learn, it is not as perfomant as Go or Rust & doesn't help the developer naturally learn the lower-level development techniques. Rust & Go also have a very steep larning curve & are getting more & more popular due to their perfoamnce. They also pay more generally. 

cakebear, like many new attempts at languages may not ever reach mass adoption but it will hopefully provide ideas around features that TypeScript / JavaScript can add like a compiled version. If this project fails but moves the needle on increasing the accessability of the tech field to diverse candidates then it will be a success!

My first attempt at decreasing the barrier of entry for more diverse candidaets is to take an easy-to-learn / much more widely known language like TypeScript & create a way to compile it down to a singel executable & get it close to or as performant as Go or Rust. This will allow companies to adopt this language as a way to get more diverse candidates with less experience & knowledge without sacrificing performance or ease of deployment.

### cakebear as a language
* Performance should be close to or as good as Go & Rust
* Fully support & keep up with TypeScript
* WON'T support TypeScript. All types will be the default types from JavaScript to make this more accessible to first-time / brand new developers
  * types are `string` & `float64` by default in JavaScript
* Have very strong & easy-to-understand documentation with examples

### Princeples of cakebear
* Be as performant as possible without sacrificing accessibility
* Follow the package management of Go or Rust by requiring approval by the cakebear org (currently know as the cakebear cave as a placeholder) before being added to the platform
* Avoid the bloat of NPM
* Have an officially supported web framework
 * Top 2 titles right now for framework are `frosting` & `honey`
